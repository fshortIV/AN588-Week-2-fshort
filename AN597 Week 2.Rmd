## R Markdown Week 2

This is an R Markdown document to be used for Week 2's Challenges. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
library(stringr)
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
m
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2)
m2

class(m1)
dim(m1)
m1
class(m2)
dim(m2)
m2
colnames(m2)

a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3))
a
```

## Including Plots
changy change 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
